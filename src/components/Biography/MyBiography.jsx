            I'm Catalin, aka <span className="text-gold">ZeroHenriot</span>. Why
            this nick? I don't know, it just sounds good.

            When I'm not tinkering with color codes, you'll find me immersing
            myself in virtual worlds, armed with a controller and ready to take
            on any enemy (or save damsels in distress!).

            I also have a soft spot for cats - those little furry beings that
            seem to rule the world (spoiler, they do) - and I could spend hours
            watching funny cat videos online.{' '}

            Despite being a sports enthusiast, I must admit that my actual
            sports participation is limited to the occasional competition on the
            virtual field.

            Oh, and let's not forget that I'm a junior front-end developer on a
            mission to bring a touch of digital magic to the world. So get ready
            to explore my digital universe of code, cats, and pixel-perfect
            wonders! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜¸ðŸ’»
